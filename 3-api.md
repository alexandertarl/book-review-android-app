I utilised the Google Books API to create a fragment that allows the user to search for any books stored in the API's library. Using this API allowed me to effectively get "access to a wide variety of data sets" (Lane 2019, para. 5) and utilise the book data set as output after the user searches for a book title.  
This feature outputs the title, author, book cover image, and Google Books link for the top 3 results for a given term searched. This API allowed me to effectively use an already well-established JSON library of books to develop a searching feature in my application with simple implementation. This book-searching feature encourages better engagement with my application as it allows the user to stay inside my application if they want to search for a new book to read after reviewing a book.  
Each outputted book has the cover outputted to an image view inside the search fragment, this makes the app more visually appealing as images can add more meaning to the search results and displays a rough idea of what a book could be about, giving the user a better idea of how useful a book will be. Only three books are outputted to this screen as the search feature is not the main feature of the application, and too many would slow down the application. However, this can still give the user a good impression of the books available according to the term searched. The link to the Google Books information page of each book is outputted, which is beneficial for giving the user more information about a book if they are interested in a specific title. Resulting in only the most crucial details are outputted to the application, which makes listing books easier.
