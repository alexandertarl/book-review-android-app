My objective is to create an application that encourages readers to submit reviews for the books they have read, by rating them by score and using additional comments. Writing these book reviews is helpful for the user to look back on and remember what they thought of a book, and maybe use data such as a book's author to find new book recommendations. This application will be useful to anyone reading books who wishes to keep track of when they complete books and write about them, as well as to discover new books.  
The application can be used like how a book tracker would be in a physical journal, due to there being no login system implemented so reviews are not visible to others.  
I also want to allow the user to search for books using the Google Books API to find new books and uncover relevant information about them. The user can add any books found to a 'To-Be-Read list' which can be broadcasted to them as a notification, which is beneficial for reminding the user to buy and read any newly found books of interest.
