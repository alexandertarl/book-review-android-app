I set out to and effectively implemented features that allows the user to write book reviews, view them, and utilise the Google Books API for book-searching.  
I initially wanted to allow the user to send a book review they wrote to a contact using the default messaging application. However, I decided to output the Google Books link of each search result because I thought this was a more appropriate implementation of external intents in my application.  
I initially struggled with understanding fragments compared to activities, which made me need to navigate code from activities to new fragments. I adapted by finding examples of when to use fragments and then re-evaluated the design of my application.  
Next time I would implement the API first to avoid the risk of any potential issues. Implementing tests alongside the development of the application would be ideal as I could focus the tests on the sections of the application more accurately.  
If I had more time I would implement a better user interface and add additional colour for a more exciting appearance. I would also implement a user login system, where users can share their book reviews publicly and create a community among the application.
